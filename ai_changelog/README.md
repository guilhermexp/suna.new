# AI Changelog Directory

## Purpose
Historical record of all changes, updates, and progress in the Suna project. Maintains a semantic versioning-based changelog for tracking features, fixes, and improvements.

## Organization
- `CHANGELOG_FORK.md` - Main changelog file (primary record)
- Dated entries following semantic versioning format (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Cross-references to related issues, commits, and specifications

## File Organization System
- **Format**: Each entry includes date, version, category (Features/Fixes/Breaking Changes), description
- **Linking**: References to related issue files, commit hashes, and specification documents
- **Frequency**: Updated after significant milestones or feature completions

## Current Documents
- (To be populated as changelog entries are created)

## Guidelines for Adding New Entries
1. Use semantic versioning: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
2. Group changes by category: Features, Fixes, Breaking Changes, Documentation, Chores
3. Include dates and cross-references
4. Reference related ai_issues/ or ai_specs/ documents where applicable
5. Update CHANGELOG_FORK.md with new entry
