## 📞 Developer Notes

### File Organization
All components follow the existing Suna structure:
- Types in `lib/types/`
- Components in `components/deer-flow/kanban/`
- Hooks in `hooks/react-query/projects/`
- Mock API in `lib/api/`

### Naming Conventions
- Components: PascalCase
- Hooks: camelCase with `use` prefix
- Types: PascalCase
- Enums: PascalCase

### Design Patterns
- Consistent with agents page structure
- Follows shadcn/ui patterns
- Uses TanStack Query for state
- Optimistic updates for better UX

### Performance Considerations
- Memoized computations
- Efficient re-renders
- Lazy loading ready
- Query caching enabled
